# IBAN Structure Test

This code checks that an IBAN is probably valid (in that it conforms to the rules). It is not, I'm afraid,
written as a module which can sensibly be incorporated into a larger project, but you're free to take
the code and tweak it to your needs.

# Disclaimer

I've done my best, and I think this is correct, but I may have messed up somewhere, in terms of either
facts or code logic. I suggest you test this thing before you use it in any way.
